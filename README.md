# Full stack app with Login - LiftUp: Send Positive Praises to your Community

In this full stack application complete with login authentification, users can create an account, login and and access a community board where they can post messages praising others in the community. They can show more support for each message by clicking the heart - numbers will go up. They can favorite a message and it will turn purple to mark it. Messages can be deleted via the trashcan as well.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

Simple design for this simple app, for the community to lift each other up and praise each other's wins. I feel more comfortable now building full stack apps with login, the CSS aspect, as well as the put/update here to change the color and increase the number of support on a message.

## Lessons Learned:

It's important to continue studying this structure and putting it into practice. I learned this week that the more I put it into practice, the easier it was to grasp the concept and understand what everything is actually doing.
